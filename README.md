# Hotel-Reservation
The Hotel Reservation System is a command-line application implemented in Python that allows tenants to make reservations and manage their information. The system is designed to manage a finite number of rooms available for reservations.

**Assumptions**<br>
    Before using this system, please note the following assumptions:<br>
 - Each tenant can only have one reservation.<br>
 - The hotel has a finite number of rooms available for reservations.<br>
 - The reservation number must be unique for each reservation.<br>
 - The system is only used for managing reservations and tenants' information.<br>
 - Check-in dates are always before checkout dates.<br>
 - The user interface is a command-line interface.<br>
 - The cost of a stay is calculated as the cost per night times the number of nights stayed.<br>
 - The system only considers one type of room for the hotel.<br>
 - The hotel only has one location.<br>
 - The system does not require authentication for access.<br>
